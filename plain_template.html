	<p> The United States has dealt with many financial problems over the past few decades. The economic crisis in 2008, the COVID-19 pandemic, and more have affected how people allocate money in this country. At times people put their money into the stock market and other forms of investing. Others purchase things and have their equity sit in their belongings. One of the most common spending fields though in the United States is housing. </p>

	<p>There are nearly 80 million occupied homes in the country, according to <a href="https://policyadvice.net/insurance/insights/home-ownership-statistics/#:~:text=21.,occupied%20homes%20in%20the%20US.&text=Owner%2Doccupied%20housing%20in%20the,million%20of%20them%20back%20then.">Statistica</a>. In addition, the average amount of people living in each home is roughly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183648/average-size-of-households-in-the-us/">2.5</a> people per home, which has stayed relatively the same since the turn of the century.</p>

	<p>With the housing market though come people taking out mortgages in order to pay for the housing. A delinquent mortgage is a mortgage that is taken out but the person responsible for paying it is unable to for whatever reason. The chart above shows how since the beginning of 2008, the percentage of delinquent mortgages in most states has decreased, which is due to the overall improvement in the national economy since 2008.</p>

	<p>The graph below shows how the housing market in New York State took time to adjust to the pandemic. At its peak in 2012, nearly 5 percent of all mortgages in the state were considered to be delinquent. </p>

	<p>The 2008 global recession led millions of people to lose their jobs, homes, and much more. There has been a steady decline in delinquent mortgages since the peak of the repercussions hit the housing market in 2012, as banks and homeowners are able to use the growing economy in order to put a bandage on the problem.</p>

	<p>That bandage though was unable to be a permanent solution. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States in early 2021, and it is still affecting the country in many ways to this day. New York State was one of the hardest-hit states by <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/01/816707182/map-tracking-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus-in-the-u-s">COVID-19</a> as more than 68 thousand people lost their lives to it so far. The economy hit its worst since the 2008 recession during the pandemic, which also affected the housing market.</p>

	<p>“I would have to assume that since delinquent mortgages have come back down since COVID’s financial effects on the United States, that they will remain relatively low until they inevitably rise again due to the country's rising inflation,” said Kevin Oliver, a New York State resident who has been working with his father in the real estate industry for two years. The current general trend since the start of 2021 shows a relatively constant decline of delinquent mortgages with little variation. Oliver states that as the economy recovers from the pandemic over time, the ability of people to make their mortgage payments on time will suffer.</p>

	<p>Inflation rates have also been on the rise. The graph above ends in September of 2021, which is the same time that inflation in the country began to steadily increase. <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_inflation_rate">Inflation rates</a> have grown from roughly 5.25% in September to 8.54% as of March 2022. To compare, when COVID-19 was first hitting the United States the hardest in the Spring of 2020, inflation rates were as low as 0.12%. </p>

	<p>Now going back to the 2008 recession, inflation rates were very low leading up to it. Between <a href="https://www.inflation.eu/en/inflation-rates/united-states/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-united-states-2009.aspx">2007 and 2012</a>, inflation jumped nearly 5%, which is similar to what is happening right now, and as mentioned earlier, delinquent mortgages were at their peak in 2012 nationwide. </p>

	<p>It is impossible to say exactly how delinquent mortgage trends will look going forward but one can look at what affects these mortgages not being paid. <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ODEP/pdf/Employment_for_PWD-Analysis_of_Trends_during_COVID_2022.pdf">Unemployment rose drastically</a> after the fall of the economy in 2008, as it didn’t retreat to its percentage from before the economic downturn until 2014. A similar trend can be seen occurring due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment skyrocketed in March and April of 2020. It has improved since then, but trends suggest that it will take time for things to be fully healed like in the past.</p>

	<p>Without jobs and income, people are unable to pay for their housing or mortgages. “The unemployment rates will naturally have a pull on delinquent mortgages along with the real estate markets that we are currently experiencing,” said Oliver. “Housing prices are extremely high and causing buyers to offer much higher than the asking price to be competitive with other buyers.”</p>

	<p>With the economy still figuring itself out after the COVID-19 pandemic, only time will tell the true direction that the economy, inflation, the housing market, and the rate at which mortgages are paid will go. Signs from past events in U.S. history can give us an idea, but the future of delinquent mortgages in New York State and the country as a whole is something that requires attention. </p>
